This example demonstrates an uncommon error in MongoDB when using the `$inc` operator with an array. The `$inc` operator is intended for incrementing numeric fields, but its direct application to an array field will lead to issues. The solution involves specifying the exact array element index to increment correctly. This problem can be difficult to debug since MongoDB may not return an error immediately, but the updated document will be incorrect.
